Hovering over the `Servers` menu brings up a list of current servers and allows you to create a new server.  Simply click the server you want to manage and [[server log]] and [[server control and status]] panels will update to reflect the selected server.

## Adding a new server

To add a new server, simply select the `New Server` option from the `Servers` menu which will then ask you for a name for your new server.

Simply enter the name and a new, blank and unstarted server will be created.  You can either start the server right away from the [[server control]] buttons or use the [[server settings]] tab to configure your server first, including using a pre-defined world seed.
