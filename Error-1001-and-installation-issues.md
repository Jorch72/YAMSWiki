The YAMS installer should cope with working out if you have the required software installed then downloading and installing what you need.  However, it seems from various support requests that this isn't happening.

If you are having trouble installing, download and install these before trying to run the YAMS Setup.  At worst, it will give you some better error messages that you can Google to find the answer.  Don't forget that it's recommended to use the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) when running a Minecraft server.
