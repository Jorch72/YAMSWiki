To import your world, first stop the service using the "YAMS Service Controller" shortcut in All Programs, or using the Services MMC snap-in.

Once the service has stopped, navigate to the install folder (defaults to "C:\Program Files\YAMS\").

All your Minecraft servers settings are stored in the "servers" folder under the ID number for the server.  E.g the full path to your first server will be C:\Program Files\YAMS\servers\1\.

In this folder will be a "world" sub-folder, replace the contents of this with the content of your own single or multi-player world folder.

Start the service again and your new world is loaded.

In a later update, you will be able to upload and download your worlds.  See the [[Planned Features]] page for more.
