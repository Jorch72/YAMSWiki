Listed here are features that aren't yet in YAMS but are either planned or have been asked for, if there is something you want that isn't listed, please put it on as an [issue](https://github.com/richardbenson/YAMS/issues).  Remember, YAMS will never mod the Minecraft server, it is an admin tool.

[[Version History]] lists all the features currently available.

## Partial
The following are partially implemented and may just need some UI work to finish off

  * User levels
  * Tectonicus rendering - Will only work under very specific conditions at the moment, needs a software rendering option
  * NBToolkit support

## Planned
These are features YAMS will **definitely** have:

  * Upload and download of world
  * Backup retention policies and access from the admin panel to your backups
  * Upload and support of plugins (either bukkit or official mod support)
  * Selection of popular map generators for generating new worlds.
  * Bukkit mod support: as long as Mojang don't get mod support out before then

## Possible
These are features that YAMS _may_ have one day:

  * Optional embedded Mumble server (Murmur) per Minecraft server

## Never
The following things will never be implemented in YAMS:

  * Intentional backdoors, or elevated privileges for developers
  * Wrapper mode: Your Minecraft client will always be talking directly to the Minecraft server (Mojang or Bukkit)
