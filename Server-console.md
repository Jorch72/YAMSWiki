![YAMS Server console log](http://yams.in/assets/images/docs/server-log-console.png)

The console tab contains the amalgamated server logs and output from the Minecraft Server itself and any [apps](Server Apps) that you run against that server.  The log colouring is the same as in the [[global log]] and the message format is similar:

    [<DATE> <TIME>] <LOG>

  * **Grey** - Informational
  * **Yellow** - Non-critical warning
  * **Red** - Error

Commands entered into the text box at the bottom of the log are issued straight to the server, you can use any of the [officially supported commands](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Server_commands) if you are running vanilla.  Commands for [Bukkit](http://bukkit.org/) can and do change, please see their site or the site for any plugins you may have installed for a list of supported commands.
