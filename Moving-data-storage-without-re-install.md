You can move the storage of all servers and related resources out of Program Files if you have another drive you would rather store it on.

1. Open the YAMS Service Controller.
2. Stop the service.
3. Enter the new path in the box under "Change Storage Path", remember to have a trailing slash on the end.
4. Click "Move Path", this will move all files to the new location.
