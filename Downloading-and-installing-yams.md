Downloading and installing is all managed through the setup file in the downloads tab, simply download this to your machine a double-click.  All dependencies will be checked, downloaded and installed if necessary.  This includes downloading the Minecraft server itself

During install, Java will be checked for and download links will be provided if it is not detected.  You may need to install Java *after* completing YAMS install due to Windows only allowing one install at a time.
