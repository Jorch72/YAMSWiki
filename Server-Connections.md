Here you will find the information your players will need to enter into their Minecraft client to be able to connect to your server from outside of your network.  If you have enable [[dynamic dns]] this will be reflected here and if you also have [[port forwarding]] enabled this should be all you ever need to set up.  Remember that a lot of routers won't allow you to connect from inside using your external address, so from inside your network use the address in the `Listen IP` section of [[server settings]].
